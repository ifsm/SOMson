					Kohonen Maps, aka. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are neural networks that visualize a high-dimensional
					feature space on a low-dimensional map. While SOMs are an excellent tool for data examination and
					exploration, they inherently cause a loss of detail. Visualizations of the underlying data do not
					integrate well and, therefore, fail to provide an overall picture. Consequently, we suggest SOMson,
					an interactive sonification of the underlying data, as a data augmentation technique. The
					sonification increases the amount of information provided simultaneously by the SOM. Instead of a
					user study, we present an interactive online example, so readers can explore SOMson themselves. Its
					strengths, weaknesses, and prospects are discussed.</br></br>
